### 1. How do you check the length of an array?

Ans :- 

- The `.length ` property is a built-in property in JavaScript that is used to retrieve the number of elements in an array or the number of characters in a string.

- When applied to an array, ` it returns the count of elements present in that array `. For a string, it returns the count of characters in the string.

```

let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(array.length); // Output: 5

```

### 2. How do you add elements to the end of an array?

Ans :

- `arr.push` is like adding something to the end of an array. In JavaScript, `when you use arr.push(element), you're putting a new thing at the very end of a list` of things called an array.

- It's like adding a new book to the end of a bookshelf, making the array longer by one item.

```
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array.push(4); // putting a new thing in array
console.log(array); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

### 3. How do you remove elements from the end of an array?

- `array.pop()`in JavaScript is like taking the last thing out of a array.
  
- `When you use it, you're removing the very last item` from a list of things called an array. It's just like plucking out the last book from the end of a row of books, making the list shorter by one item.



### 4. How do you remove elements from the beginning of an array?

- array.shift() in JavaScript is a way to remove the first element from a list of items, which is called an array. 

- It takes away the very first thing in the list and shortens the array by one element. It's like taking out the first book from a shelf full of books, making the array shorter and starting the list from the second item.


### 5. How do you add elements to the beginning of an array?

- The unshift() method adds new elements to the beginning of an array. In JavaScript, when you use array.unshift(element), you're putting a new thing at the very beginning of a  array.

- It's similar to adding a new book to the front of a bookshelf, making the array longer by one item, but now the new item is first.

``````
let array = [2, 3, 4];
array.unshift(1);
console.log(array); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
``````
