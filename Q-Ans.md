## For Loop

#### What are the different types of loops in JavaScript?


JavaScript supports several types of loops, including  `for`,  `while`, and `do...while loops`.





#### Explain the difference between for and while loops in JavaScript.

Ans :-



`A for loop is` typically `used` when you know the number of iterations in advance, while a while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and is determined by a condition.
 

#### How do you exit a loop prematurely in JavaScript?

Ans :-


You can exit a loop prematurely `using the break statement`.

#### What is the purpose of the continue statement in JavaScript loops?

Ans :-



The `continue statement is used to skip` the `current iteration of a loop ` and `continue to the next iteration`.

#### What is an infinite loop, and how can you prevent it?

Ans :-



An `infinite loop is a loop that never terminates `. To prevent it, make sure the loop's exit condition is reachable and will eventually evaluate to false.

#### What is a for...in loop in JavaScript, and when is it commonly used?

Ans :-



`A for...in loop is used to` iterate over the properties of an object. It's commonly used for `object iteration`.

#### What is a for...of loop in JavaScript, and when is it commonly used?


Ans :-


`A for...of loop is used` to `iterate over the values` of iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, and maps.

#### Explain the concept of "hoisting" in relation to loops in JavaScript.


Ans :-


In JavaScript, ` variable declarations are hoisted ` to the `top of their containing function` or block scope. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of it, especially in loops.

#### How can you iterate over the elements of an array in JavaScript using a for loop?


Ans :-

 You can `use a for loop with an index variable to iterate over the elements` of an array by using the array's length property.

#### What is the difference between forEach and for...of loops for iterating over arrays in JavaScript?

Ans :-

 The `` forEach method is a higher-order function` that takes a callback function and applies it to each element of the array, `while a for...of loop directly iterates over the values of the array`.
